            <article><h3><strong>Gluten-Free</strong></h3>A gluten-free diet is a diet that excludes the protein gluten. Gluten is found in grains such as wheat, barley, rye, and a cross between wheat and rye called triticale. A gluten-free diet is primarily used to treat celiac disease. Gluten causes inflammation in the small intestines of people with celiac disease. Gluten intolerance or sensitivity. People with non-celiac gluten sensitivity do not have damage to their intestinal lining. However, they experience headaches, bloating, fatigue, or diarrhea after eating foods containing gluten. As a result, they find that a gluten-free diet improves the quality of life.<a href="https://www.glutenfreeliving.com/gluten-free-foods/diet/basic-diet/">Gluten Free Living</a></article>
            
            <article><h3><strong>Healthy Alternatives</strong></h3>We all love the classic dessert version of Pecan Pie, but I'm not crazy about the processed ingredients like white sugar, refined flour, and pasteurized butter.
